"# ai-audio-recognition-py" 
An audio recognition system that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and the Speech Recognition API to analyze and identify spoken words or phrases. The system first converts the audio input into a digital signal and then extracts relevant features, such as pitch and spectral information, from the signal. These features are then used as input for the KNN algorithm, which compares them to a pre-existing dataset of known audio samples and determines the closest match. The Speech Recognition API is used to further improve the accuracy of the system by providing additional context and language-specific information. The resulting output of the system is the identified spoken word or phrase.
In addition to analyzing and identifying spoken words or phrases, the audio recognition system also generates graphical representations of the audio input. These include a graph that visualizes the audio signal over time, displaying changes in amplitude and frequency, and a heat graph that illustrates the distribution of energy across different frequency bands. These graphical representations provide a visual representation of the audio input and can be used for further analysis and understanding of the audio signal. The graphical representation can be useful for understanding the audio patterns, detecting outliers, and identifying the specific attributes of the audio. Overall, the audio recognition system, implemented with KNN algorithm and Speech Recognition API, provides not only the accurate recognition results but also the visual representation which can help in better understanding of the audio.
